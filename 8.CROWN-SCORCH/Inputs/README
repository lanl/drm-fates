Great question, the bulk density in the grass and litter is the density in the fuel layer not the cell. In FIRETEC, the bottom cell is separated into two parts for the purposes of computing drag, fuel with a depth, and non-fuel. So the average value of the cell would be this bulk density*fueldepth/cellheight. Caveat here, the bulk density here is the maximum litter/grass. There is a shadow component calculated in the code based-off fuel in the vertical column (i.e. canopy fuel above the ground) where there is no canopy the grass bulk density will be maxed and the litter bulk density will be zero. Visa versa for heavy canopy.
Yes, each column corresponds to a different tree species. In this case I think it was a douglas fir and a lodgepole pine in interior BC. Each tree will create multiple fuel types: 1 for each tfuelbin and 1 for litter. I like to use 1 tfuelbin for canopy leaves/needles and another for branches, but you could lump it together or divide it up further as you please.
Sorry for no header, this is a typical treelist that the forest service might send us where each individual tree is measured and placed. In this case each row is a new tree and the columns would be 1) tree species 2) x coordinate 3) y coordinate 4) height 5) crown base height 6) crown width 7) height to maximum crown width 8) canopy bulk density 9) average moisture content 10) average sizescale

Iâ€™ve made a python script that can do it on the HPC systems. To use this you have to concatenate the four fuel files into one
 
cat treesrhof.dat > fuels.dat
cat treesmoist.dat >> fuels.dat
cat treesss.dat >> fuels.dat
cat treesfueldepth.dat >> fuels.dat
