###
Use SEB-LIGHT.cpp
Requires fuel file from FIRETEC or QUICFIRE and meterolgical file.
Fuel file:          treesrhof.dat
meterological File: EglinMetData.txt  ### This is the file that you would add in your sunlight input.
### The QswIn (shortwave radiation) 2nd column.  
### First Column is a timestep tracker.  This data is 10min data, but can be what ever you since you are not running the surface energy balance.
### All other columns can be whatever, LongwaveRadiaiton, AirTemperature, RelativeHumidity, Windspeed, Precipitation 


Inputlist:          ### I just made this for you, we can change easily, and would likely need to add to it.
