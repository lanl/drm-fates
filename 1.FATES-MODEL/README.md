# FATES-DRM
### Step 1: Create the FATES case 
setup and run ./create_FATES_DRM.sh
You will need to set: 
user: your moniker
TAG: A name of your case
SITE_BASE_DIR: Where are you building your case
ex: "/lustre/scratch5/.mdt1/${user}/E3SM_cases/Eglin"   # Where is the site folder located? (SITE_NAME)
DATA_DIR: Where is this repository (where the internal data is stored)
ex: "/lustre/scratch5/.mdt1/zjrobbins/FATES-DRM" 

And the time of simulation at line 100-109


### Step 2: Run FATES_DRM.csh this will call the additional files
This will need you to set the case the following variables: 
   E3SM_CASE_CLONE: What is the name of your case. 
   CLONE_ROOT: Where are the FATES runs stored. 
   SRC: The location of these scripts
   RUN_ROOT: Where is the root where FATES is run
   STOP_N: How often to stop and run Quicfire

Results: Outputs will be stored in the following places: 
## Fates outputs
$RUN_ROOT/$E3SM_CASE_CLONE/run/$E3SM_CASE_CLONE.elm.h0*
$RUN_ROOT/$E3SM_CASE_CLONE/run/$E3SM_CASE_CLONE.elm.r*
## Fire Outputs
$RUN_ROOT/drm-fates/1.FATES-MODEL/VDM2FM/Pre_fire*
$RUN_ROOT/drm-fates/1.FATES-MODEL/FM2VDM/Afterfire*
$RUN_ROOT/drm-fates/1.FATES-MODEL/VDM2FM/fuels*
