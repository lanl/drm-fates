# HVI scoring metric
# l_bnd: lower boundary 
# h_bnd: high boundary,
# bn: benchmarking number, # of elements (trees) per area A, 
# n and m: number of cols and rows in the area A(n,m)
# s: smoothing or score relaxation factor (sc=1 for all elements in [bn-s,bn+s]) 
# param | l_bnd | h_bnd | bn | n | m | s |
