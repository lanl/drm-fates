LLM-HSM
=======

Longleaf Pine Hardwood Model - Habitat Suitability Model (LLM-HSM) is a coupled model. The Longleaf Pine Hardwood Model incorporates tree demography, plant competition, fuel accumulation, and general fire characteristics and simulated longleaf pine hardwood forest evolution [#lou11]_. The Habitat Suitability Model complements the LLM and simulates endangered species habitat over time in response to fire management at the longleaf pine-hardwood ecosystem [#jaf21]_.  

LLM-HSM model represents the coupled version of the LLM and HSM model. The LLM-HSM uses modified version of the LLM. The modified version includes improved modular functionality of the LLM and additional capabilities such as calculation of the dbh and crown radius for the longleaf pine and hardwood trees. The ipython notebook includes step-by-step tutorial of the DRM framework.
