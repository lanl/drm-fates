Tree Program 
============

The original version of the code is developed and maintained by Alexander Josephson (email:alexanderj@lanl.gov). This version was customized by Elchin Jafarov and Adam Atchley to allow better compatibility with the LLM-HSM. The Trees program is a pre-processing tool used to virtually build forest fuel arrays to be read into FIRETEC or QUIC-Fire. Tree program uses outputs from the LLM-HSM and builds inputs for FT and QF.
